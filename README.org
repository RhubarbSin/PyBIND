This directory contains python modules for creating and writing BIND configuration files and zone files.

These modules are are not intended or suitable for general manipulation of
zones and zone files; use dnspython for that. These were created specifically for /writing/ files rather than parsing or otherwise manipulating them.

Terminology and other reference information have been taken from ZYTRAX, Inc.'s "DNS for Rocket Scientists" (http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns).

Patches and suggestions are welcome, but I created these of course to address my own uses.

Add license information!
